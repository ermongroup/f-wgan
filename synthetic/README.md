# Experiments on synthetic data

Here are the code to reproduce the results in the synthetic data experiments for KL-WGAN.

## Files

- `kl_wgan.py`: experiments for generative modeling on synthetic 2d data
- `kl_wgan_real.py`: experiments for generative modeling on UCI data
- `generative_modeling_plots.ipynb`: after running the experiments and saving the results in `save_{id}`, generate the plots used in the paper
- `density_ratios.ipynb`: generate the plots in the density ratio experiments.
